## Export GLB

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select the state">
    View the state you want to export and deselect any object.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Export State">
    In the settings panel on the right, click on `Export State`
  </Step>
</Steps>

## GLB structure
The exported GLB file will use the Ordinary Objects' `World Anchor` as origin `x = 0`, `y = 0`, `z = 0`.
This ensures that your exported file can be used in various other ways and tools such as the Meta Spatial Editor, Unity3D, Unreal etc. with a shared understanding of an origin.
