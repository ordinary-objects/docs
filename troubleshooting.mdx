# Vision Pro

- Plane Anchors are not supported for Vision Pro yet. Use the World or Spatial Anchors instead.
- Using the OO Advanced Material will crash the Vision Pro Mirror. Simply change it to any of the other materials. If you need complex materials, create the object in another software like blender and import the asset with the intended material.
- Use the **New Quest 3 Project** button to create a new project for Vision Pro.
